 * safely paused at any time using paused(boolean), and can be set to sleep for
 * an arbitrary interval upon each iteration using sleepFor(int). In your
 * subclass you must at least provide an implementation for runCode() containing
 * your main service code, as this method is invoked once per iteration of the
 * thread loop.
