/**
 * Fluent Vapor companion to HorizontalScrollView, a layout container for a view
 * hierarchy that can be scrolled by the user, allowing it to be larger than the
 * physical display. A HorizontalScrollView is a FrameLayout, meaning you should
 * place one child in it containing the entire contents to scroll; this child
 * may itself be a layout manager with a complex hierarchy of objects. A child
 * that is often used is a LinearLayout in a horizontal orientation, presenting
 * a horizontal array of top-level items that the user can scroll through.
