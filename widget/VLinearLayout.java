/**
 * Fluent Vapor companion to LinearLayout, a Layout that arranges its children
 * in a single column or a single row. The direction of the row can be set by
 * calling orientation(int). You can also specify gravity, which specifies the
 * alignment of all the child elements by calling gravity(int) or specify that
 * specific children grow to fill up any remaining space in the layout by
 * setting the weight member of LinearLayout.LayoutParams. The default
 * orientation is horizontal.
