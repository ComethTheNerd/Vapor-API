 * Fluent variadic Vapor companion to TabHost, a container for a tabbed window
 * view. This object holds two children: a set of tab labels that the user
 * clicks to select a specific tab, and a FrameLayout object that displays the
 * contents of that page. The individual elements are typically controlled using
 * this container object, rather than setting values on the child elements
 * themselves.
