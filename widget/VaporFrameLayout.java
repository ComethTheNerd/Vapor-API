/**
 * Fluent Vapor companion to FrameLayout, designed to block out an area on the
 * screen to display a single item. Generally, FrameLayout should be used to
 * hold a single child view, because it can be difficult to organize child views
 * in a way that's scalable to different screen sizes without the children
 * overlapping each other. You can, however, add multiple children to a
 * FrameLayout and control their position within the FrameLayout by assigning
 * gravity to each child, using the android:layout_gravity attribute.
