/**
 * Fluent variadic Vapor companion to ScrollView, a layout container for a view
 * hierarchy that can be scrolled by the user, allowing it to be larger than the
 * physical display. A ScrollView is a FrameLayout, meaning you should place one
 * child in it containing the entire contents to scroll; this child may itself
 * be a layout manager with a complex hierarchy of objects. A child that is
 * often used is a LinearLayout in a vertical orientation, presenting a vertical
 * array of top-level items that the user can scroll through.
