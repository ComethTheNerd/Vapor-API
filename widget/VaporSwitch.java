 * Fluent Vapor companion to Switch, a two-state toggle switch widget that can
 * select between two options. The user may drag the "thumb" back and forth to
 * choose the selected option, or simply tap to toggle as if it were a checkbox.
 * The text property controls the text displayed in the label for the switch,
 * whereas the off and on text controls the text on the thumb.
