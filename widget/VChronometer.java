/**
 * Fluent Vapor companion to Chronometer, a class that implements a simple
 * timer. You can give it a start time in the elapsedRealtime() timebase, and it
 * counts up from that, or if you don't give it a base time, it will use the
 * time at which you call tick(true). By default it will display the current
 * timer value in the form "MM:SS" or "H:MM:SS", or you can use format(String)
 * to format the timer value into an arbitrary string.
