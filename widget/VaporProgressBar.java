 * Fluent Vapor companion to ProgressBar, a visual indicator of progress in some
 * operation. Displays a bar to the user representing how far the operation has
 * progressed; the application can change the amount of progress (modifying the
 * length of the bar) as it moves forward. There is also a secondary progress
 * displayable on a progress bar which is useful for displaying intermediate
 * progress, such as the buffer level during a streaming playback progress bar.
