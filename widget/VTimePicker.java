/**
 * Fluent Vapor companion to TimePicker, a view for selecting the time of day,
 * in either 24 hour or AM/PM mode. The hour, each minute digit, and AM/PM (if
 * applicable) can be controlled by vertical spinners. The hour can be entered
 * by keyboard input. Entering in two digit hours can be accomplished by hitting
 * two digits within a timeout of about a second (e.g. '1' then '2' to select
 * 12). The minutes can be entered by entering single digits. Under AM/PM mode,
 * the user can hit 'a', 'A", 'p' or 'P' to pick. For a dialog using this view,
 * see TimePickerDialog.
